# 45-Day Coding Challenge ðŸš©

Welcome to the 45-Day Coding Challenge repository! This is a personal project where I have undertaken the challenge to solve 4-5 coding questions from LeetCode or GeeksforGeeks every day for 45 days. In this repository, you will find my solutions. #CrackYourInternship #CrackYourPlacement

## Motivation ðŸŽ“

The purpose of this challenge is to enhance my problem-solving skills, improve my coding efficiency, and explore different programming concepts and algorithms. By consistently practicing coding problems, I aim to sharpen my logical thinking abilities and broaden my knowledge in various domains of computer science.

## Day-wise Progress

The following table provides an overview of the 45-day challenge, indicating the completion status for each day's coding questions.

Sure, here's the table divided into 15 rows:
